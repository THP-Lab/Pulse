# 🚀 Pulse for the Ethereum Applications

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Pulse** is a next-generation Web3 application designed to transform how communities and organizations interact through voting. Built to be engaging, accessible, and secure, Pulse enables companies to capture real-time sentiment from their users — turning passive audiences into active participants.

The app is fully integrated with the **Worldcoin MiniApp Marketplace** via the **Worldcoin Minikit**, and leverages the **Intuition.system protocol** to contribute to the building of decentralized online reputation with the Intuition protocol. Pulse doesn't just capture opinions — it anchors them to a verifiable, trust-based system.

## 🔗 Key Integrations & Reputation Framework

### 🌍 Worldcoin Minikit Integration
Pulse has been built using the **Worldcoin Minikit**, making it fully compatible with the **Worldcoin MiniApp Marketplace**. This ensures a seamless user experience for verified World ID holders, enabling:
- **Frictionless onboarding** with secure identity verification.
- **Authentic voting** from real, unique individuals.
- **Direct integration into the World App ecosystem.**

### 🧠 Intuition Protocol – Reputation Through Collective Knowledge

Pulse contributes to a **decentralized knowledge graph** powered by [Intuition.system](https://intuition.system), where each interaction becomes part of a shared reputation layer for the internet.

#### 🧩 Core Concepts:
- **Atom**: A core identity (person, organization, or concept).
- **Signal**: A meaningful statement or opinion about an atom.
- **Triplet**: A structured data entry in the format:  
  **Subject (Atom)** + **Predicate (Claim)** + **Object (Qualifier)**

🗳️ **Each vote in Pulse becomes a triplet**, enriching the reputation and context of entities across Web3.

> Example:
> - *Company A* (Atom)  
> - *is trusted by* (Predicate)  
> - *70% of its community* (Object)

Through this system, **Pulse goes beyond polling** — it builds a **transparent, verifiable reputation layer** for users, projects, and organizations alike.
